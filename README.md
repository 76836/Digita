# Digita
Local AI in a way that feels human, and supports running locally on all your devices.
Go to https://76836.github.io/Digita to access the PWA.

The Digita Project is focused on bringing lifelike, human-style interaction to your machine, using a mix of several AI models to fit your scenario.
It’s designed to power responsive, offline virtual companions that can hold conversations, remember context, and run entirely in your browser without needing the cloud.
Whether it’s chatting, helping with tasks, or just being present, this project aims makes the AI feel less like a tool and more like someone.
At it's core, this is built on the panels system, each panel is a completely seperate AI app made to run a specific task, like speech recognition, or an AI chat.
Digita System links these panels together into one seamless AI experience that I call a Digita, an all-in-one AI, not just a chatbot, not a general purpose model, not just an assistant, but not quite a lifeform, just a Digita.

Yeah this is another AI waifu project, it's super easy to use and runs locally though so still cool.
